📋 Prerequisites
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Account.

Node.js Installed: Verify using node -v and npm -v.

Compartment OCID: Obtain the OCID of the compartment where you want to create the table.

🚀 Getting Started
Task 1: Install the Oracle NoSQL SDK
You do not need to download the SDK manually from a browser. You install it using the Node Package Manager (npm).

Open your terminal/command prompt.

Navigate to your project folder: (eg = E:\Thinkoci_db)

Run the following command:

#npm install oracle-nosqldb

This creates a node_modules directory containing the SDK.

Task 2: Configure the Sample Application
Download the HelloWorld.js file provided in the lab.

Open HelloWorld.js in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).

Edit the Configuration: Locate the NoSQLClient section and update the placeholders:

compartment: Paste your Compartment OCID.

region: Enter your OCI region (e.g., us-ashburn-1 or ap-hyderabad-1).

Save the file.

Task 3: Execute the Application
Run the script using Node.js:


#node HelloWorld.js
